 ### Angular folder structure:-(Always prefer module)
```
 1.Feature module --> Admin,Buyer(all the features based on our application)
 2.Core Faeture module --> (components of forgot pwd,resert-pwd,user-login,user-register)
 3.Home module --> (Home Page)
 4.Models --> (Should be in a separate folder)
 5.Shared module --> (Hader,Footer)
```


 ## steps:-


1. To install the angular 
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
2. Create a projects:-
```
ng new <projectname>
```
3. To run the application :-

```
ng serve --open 
(or)
ng s -o 
(or)
npm start
```
4. To install angular material
```
npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animation
```
5.  Let's generate core folder and my-test module
6. Let's now add one component in the core folder

```
ng generate component user-login
```
7. Add one module in the app folder

```
ng generate module myTest           
```
8. Add one component inside the module

9. Add A services which helps to pass data between different component

```
ng generate service services/course
```

10. To transfer data from one component to another:- 
    
    i. (In service folder)
    ```
        private dataSource = new BehaviorSubject({});
        currmsg = this.dataSource.asObservable();

        dataChange(courses:any){
            this.dataSource.next(courses);
        }
    ```
    ii. Now add the service to the provider list of the module.ts file

    iii.
